The consistency across people and across groups (patients and doctors) in the rating (ordering and quantifying) of probability terms (numbers and words) in fertility contexts. 

The data analysis will be updated through out my PhD. So far, I have passed my fist year PhD review. The main output from my first year is the data exclusion utilizing the Maximum likelihood estimation, in which we found the clustering issue within both our patients and doctors datasets. I will talk about it more in-depth in the future. 

The Codes will include Simulation code (which we utilized Maximum likelihood estimation detecting the clusering issue), Validation code (which we compare different cluser models), Analysis code (which we will do analysis based on our research questions).

1. 'Fertility_prob._Ordering_task_simulation.R' under 'Simulation' folder under 'Coding' folder has been updated. This doc includes both patients and doctors data exclusion codes, which illustrate and fix clustering problem within the data.  
2. Next will update the 'Fertility_prob._Ordering_task_validation.R' file and compare the effects of cleaning the data.
